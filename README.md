# Paint-Hydro

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

HACC hydro simulations provide start formation histories throughout the
simulations. One can also extract metallicity (or metallicity
histories). These can be used with Fast Spectral synthesis models (FSPS)
to obtain SEDs (narrow-band or photometric colors)

## Install

``` sh
pip install paint_hydro
```

## How to use

Loading the star formation histories and time steps
